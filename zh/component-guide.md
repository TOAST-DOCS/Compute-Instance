## NAT Instance
NAT instance is an instance that allows you to access internet over a specific IP address band in the private network instance.
This feature is only available in the Korea (Pangyo) and Korea (Pyeongchon) regions.

### Key Features
* The instance of a private network not connect with an internet gateway can access the internet via the NAT instance.
* Accesses the Internet by changing the floating IP of the NAT instance to source IP.
* The packets delivered to the NAT instance are delivered according to the routing setting of the routing table connected to the subnet of NAT instance.
* Do not add a route setting that specifies the NAT instance as a gateway in the routing table connected to the subnet of the NAT instance.
* The instance of a private network cannot receive the inbound traffic coming from the internet.
* Specifies IP address bandwidth of destination to allow Internet access through the NAT instance.
* Allows access to another instance by accessing the NAT instance.
* Sets security group.
* Sets network ACL.
* Redundancy not supported.
* The option of checking network source/target must be disabled in the Network Interface settings for the NAT instance to work.
* If a private image is created with NAT instance, the function might not work normally.
* The NAT instance provides The NAT feature only for one network interface.

> [Note] Difference with NAT gateway
>
> | Classification | NAT gateway | NAT instance |
> |--|--|--|
> |Availability| Redundancy supported | Redundancy not supported |
> |Maintenance|Maintained by NHN Cloud| Directly maintained by users|
> |Security group|Not settable| Settable|Amount
> |Network ACL| Settable | Settable|
> |SSH|Unavailable| Available|

### Source/target check setting
For the NAT instance to work normally, the option of checking network source/target must be disabled in the Network Interface settings.

### Routing setting
Specifies the NAT instance as a route gateway. The packets delivered to the NAT instance are delivered according to the routing setting of the routing table connected to the subnet of NAT instance.

### Caution on settings
* Using only one network interface for a NAT instance is recommended. Even if you connect multiple network interfaces to a NAT instance, the NAT feature is only available for one interface (eth0).
* Do not add a routing setting that specifies the NAT instance as a gateway in the routing table connected to the subnet of the NAT instance.
* It is strongly recommended to separate the NAT instance subnet from the subnet of an instance that is going to use the NAT instance as a gateway and use a different routing table.
* If the NAT instance subnet and the subnet of an instance that is going to use the NAT instance as a gateway are the same or they are connected to the same routing table, and you have to add a routing setting that specifies the NAT instance as a gateway, then a floating IP must be set for the NAT instance. Also, the target CIDR must be set to IP Prefix 0 (/0). Any other settings will only cause the communication to fail, and might impact the communication of all instances that use the routing table.

> [Note] Routing setting for NAT instance
>
> * If the subnet of NAT instance is connected to Routing Table 1 and the instances that are going to use the NAT instance as a gateway are connected to Routing Table 2
>     * In the routing setting of Routing Table 2, the NAT instance can be specified as a gateway for a specific CIDR (e.g. 8.8.8.8/32).
>     * You should specify the NAT instance as a gateway in the route setting of Routing Table 1 except in the case of the NAT instance connected to a floating IP, in which case IP prefix 0 (/0) can be set for the target CIDR.
> * If the NAT instance subnet and the subnet of instances that are going to use the NAT instance as a gateway are both connected to Routing Table 1
>     * If NAT instance is connected to a floating IP, IP Prefix 0 (/0) can be set for the target CIDR to route.
>     * Without using the above settings, you should not specify the NAT instance as a gateway in the routing setting of Routing Table 1.


## MS-SQL Instance
After instance is created, access the instance by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
To that end, an instance must be associated with a floating IP and TCP port 3389 (RDP) must be allowed for security group.

![mssqlinstance_02_201812](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_ms_sql/mssqlinstance_02_201812_en.png)

Click **+ Check Password** to check password by using key pair configured along with instance creation.
Click **Associate** and download .rdp file, to access the instance by using the acquired password.

### Initial Settings after Microsoft SQL Image is Created  

#### 1. Set SQL Certification Mode  

The default certification mode of the server is set with"**Windows Certification Mode**".
To use Microsoft SQL database account, the mode must be changed to SQL Certification Mode.

Execute Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and associate to an object under the instance name.

![mssqlinstance_03_201812](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_ms_sql/mssqlinstance_03_201812_en.png)

1. Select an object, right-click it, and choose **Attributes**.
2. On **Server Attributes** , click **Security**.
3. Change the **Server Certification** type into **SQL Server and Windows Certification Mode**.

※ To apply the changed SQL certification mode, restart Microsoft SQL.

#### 2. Change Microsoft SQL Service Port

The default port 1433 for Microsoft SQL is widely known and might serve as a security vulnerability.   
A change is recommended to another port.
※ For Express, no default port is specified.

Execute SQL Server configuration manager as below.

![mssqlinstance_04_201812](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_ms_sql/mssqlinstance_04_201812_en.png)

1. Click **Protocol for MSSQLSERVER** below **SQL Server Network Configuration** from menu on the left.

3. Select the **IP Address** tab.
4. Select **IP ALL** on the list and change the port number to another.  

※ To apply the changed service port, restart Microsoft SQL.

#### 3. Allow External Access to Microsoft SQL Database

To allow external access to Microsoft SQL Database, go to the **Security Group** tab of **Network > VPC** and add Microsoft SQL service port for security rules.
Also, register Microsoft SQL service port (default port: 1433) to allow access, as well as remote IP.  

### Data Volume Assignment  

Microsoft SQL data/log files (MDF/LDF) and backup files are recommended to be applied with separate block storages.  

![mssqlinstance_05_201812](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_ms_sql/mssqlinstance_05_201812_en.png)

Go to **Compute > Instance > Block Storage** and create a block storage.  
**Universal SSD** is a recommended volume type for improved performance.

After a block storage is created, select the storage and click **Association Management** and associate it to an instance.  

![mssqlinstance_06_201812](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_ms_sql/mssqlinstance_06_201812_en.png)

<br/>

Access instance with RDP and execute **Computer Management**, and go to **Storage>Disk Management**.

![mssqlinstance_07_201812](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_ms_sql/mssqlinstance_07_201812_en.png)

You can find the associated block storage is detected. To use it, initialize disk first.
1. Right-click the **Disk 1** block and click **Initialize Disk**.
2. Select a partition type and click **OK**.

<br/>

After initialization is completed, create disk volume.

## MySQL Instance
### Starting/Stopping MySQL

```
#Start mysql Service
shell> service mysqld start

#Stop mysql Service
shell> service mysqld stop

#Restart mysql Service
shell> service mysqld restart
```

### Connecting to MySQL

For initial connection, connect to MySQL with default user name.

```
shell> mysql -uroot
```

### Initial Settings for MySQL Instance

#### 1\. Setting Password

There's no password on root user on initial installation. Therefore, it is required to set password as soon as possible.  

```
mysql> ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'NEW PASSWORD';
```

Default MySQL validate_password_policy is as below:

* validate\_password\_policy=MEDIUM
* Must be more than 8 characters, and include numbers, lower/upper cases, and special characters.

#### 2\. Changing Port Number

The default MySQL port number is 3306. It is recommended to change the port number for security reasons.

```
shell> vi /etc/my.cnf


# Specify a port to use in the my.cnf file.

port = Port name to use


# Save vi editor Save editor


# Restart mysql service  


shell> service mysqld restart


#Connect with the changed port number


shell> mysql -uroot -P[changed port number]
```

### Description of my.cnf

The default path of my.cnf is /etc/my.cnf, and NHN Cloud recommended variables are set as below:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| default\_storage\_engine | Specify a default storage engine: Default is InnoDB with Online-DDL and transactions available. |
| expire\_logs\_days | Set log expiration period for logs provided by binlog settings. Default is three days. |
| innodb\_log\_file\_size | Specify the size of log files which save redo logs of transactions. <br>Recommended size is 256MB or higher in actual environment, and it is set as 512MB by default. In order for the changes to take effect, please restart the database. |
| innodb\_file\_per\_table | When a table is deleted or truncated, the table space is immediately returned to the OS. |
| innodb\_log\_files\_in\_group | Set the number of innodb\_log\_file files and use them in circular fashion: requires at least two. |
| log_timestamps | Default log time of MySQL 5.7 is displayed in UTC time format; therefore, change log time to system local time. |

## PostgreSQL Instance
### How to start/stop PostgreSQL

```
#Start postgresql service
shell> sudo systemctl start postgresql-13

#Stop postgresql service
shell> sudo systemctl stop postgresql-13

#Restart postgresql service
shell> sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13
```

### Log in to PostgreSQL

In the beginning after creating an image, log in as shown below.
<br>

```
#Switch account to postgres and log in
shell> sudo su - postgres
shell> psql
```

### Create PostgreSQL instance and perform initial setup

#### 1\. Change port

The image port provided is 5432, the default PostgreSQL port. Port change is recommended for security purposes.
<br>

```
shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/postgresql.conf


#Specify the port to be used in the postgresql.conf file.

port =name of the port to use


#Save vi editor


#Restart postgresql service

shell> sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13


#Log in with the changed port as shown below

shell> psql -p[changed port number]
```

#### 2\. Change server log timezone

The default timezone recorded in the server log is set to UTC. It is recommended to change it to match the local time of the SYSTEM.
<br>

```
shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/postgresql.conf


#Specify the timezone to be used in the postgresql.conf file.

log_timezone = timezone to use


#Save vi editor


#Restart postgresql service

shell> sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13


#Log in to postgresql

shell> psql


#Check the changed settings

postgres=# SHOW log_timezone;
```

#### 3\. Cancel public schema permission

Since all users are provided with CREATE and USAGE permissions for public schema by default, users who can log in to the DB can create objects in public schema. It is recommended to cancel the permissions so that no users can create objects in public schema.
<br>

```
#Log in to postgresql

shell> psql


#Run permission cancellation command

postgres=# REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

#### 4\. Allow remote login

To allow logins other than local host, you need to change the listen_addresses variable and client authentication setup file.
<br>

```
shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/postgresql.conf


#Specify the address to be used in the postgresql.conf file.
#To allow all IPv4 addresses, 0.0.0.0
#To allow all IPv6 addresses, ::
#To allow all addresses, *

listen_addresses = address to allow


#Save vi editor


shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf


#Client authentication control per IP address format
#Since old client library is not supported by scram-sha-256, it needs to be changed to md5

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    allowed DB           allowed user          allowed address                   scram-sha-256
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    allowed DB           allowed user          allowed address                   scram-sha-256


#Restart postgresql service

shell> sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13
```

## Kafka Instance
> [Note]
> This guide is created based on Kafka version 3.3.1.
> If you are using a different version, please makes changes accordingly.
> For the instance flavor, please choose c1m2 (CPU 1core,  Memory 2GB) or higher specifications.

### Start and Stop Zookeeper, Kafka broker
```
# Start Zookeeper, Kafka broker (Zookeeper first)
shell> sudo systemctl start zookeeper.service
shell> sudo systemctl start kafka.service

# Stop Zookeeper, Kafka broker (Kafka broker first)
shell> sudo systemctl stop kafka.service
shell> sudo systemctl stop zookeeper.service

# Restart Zookeeper, Kafka broker
shell> sudo systemctl restart zookeeper.service
shell> sudo systemctl restart kafka.service
```

### Install Kafka Cluster
- Must install in a new instance.
- An odd number of instances (3 or more) are required, and the installation script is executed in the instance.
- An instance consists of of one kafka broker and one zookeeper node.
- The key pair (PEM file) required to connect to another instance must be located at the ~ path of the instance running the installation script. The key pair of cluster instances must be the same.
- Only default port installation is supported. If you need to change the port, change the port by referring to the initial settings guide after completing cluster installation.
- For Kafka-related port communication between instances, set security group as follows.

Set security group
```
Direction: Inbound
IP protocol: TCP
Port: 22, 9092, 2181, 2888, 3888
```
How to check Hostname and IP

##### Cluster Installation Complete #####
```

### Initial Setup After Creating Kafka Instance
#### Change the Port
After initial installation, the ports are 9092, which is the Kafka default port, and 2181, which is the Zookeeper default port. It is recommended to change the port for security.

##### 1) Modify the ~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties file
Open the ~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties file and enter the Zookeeper port to change in clientPort.
```
shell> vi ~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties

clientPort=zookeeper port to change
```
##### 2) Modify the ~/kafka/config/server.properties file
Open the ~/kafka/config/server.properties file and enter the Kafka port to change in listeners.

How to check Instance IP
```
Private IP on the console screen
or shell> hostname -i
```
```
shell> vi ~/kafka/config/server.properties

# Uncomment
listeners=PLAINTEXT://Instance IP:kafka port to change

# Change Zookeeper port
zookeeper.connect=Instance IP:zookeeper port to change
---> If it is a cluster, change Zookeeper port of each instance IP
```

##### 3) Restart Zookeeper, Kafka broker
Restart the zookeeper and the kafka for the port change to take effect.
```
shell> sudo systemctl stop kafka.service
shell> sudo systemctl stop zookeeper.service

shell> sudo systemctl start zookeeper.service
shell> sudo systemctl start kafka.service
```

##### 4) Check Zookeeper, Kafka Port Change
Check if the changed port is in use.
```
shell> netstat -ntl | grep [Kafka port]
shell> netstat -ntl | grep [Zookeeper port]
```
### Create and Use Kafka Topic and Data

Create and query a topic
```
# Instance IP = Private IP / Kafka default port = 9092
# Create a topic
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka

# Query a topic list
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT]

# Check the details of the topic
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka

# Delete a topic
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --delete --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka
```
Create and use data
```
# Start producer
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list  [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka

# Start consumer
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --from-beginning --topic kafka
```

## Redis Instance

### Start/Stop Redis
```
# Start Redis
shell> sudo systemctl start redis

# Stop Redis
shell> sudo systemctl stop redis

# Restart Redis
shell> sudo systemctl restart redis
```

### Connect to Redis
Connect to a Redis instance by using the `redis-cli` command.
```
shell> redis-cli
```

### Initial Setup After Creating a Redis Instance
The default configuration file for a Redis instance is the `~/redis/redis.conf` file. The description for the parameters to be changed is as follows.

#### Bind
- Default value: `127.0.0.1 -::1`
- Changed value: `<private ip> 127.0.0.1 -::1`

Value for an IP used by Redis. To allow access to a Redis instance from outside the server, add a private IP to the parameter. You can check the private IP with the `hostname -I` command.

#### Port
- Default value: `6379`

Port is 6379, a default value for Redis. It is recommended to change the port for security reasons. After changing the port, you can connect to Redis with the following command.

```
shell> redis-cli -p <new port>
```

#### Requirepass/masterauth
- Default value: `nhncloud`

The default password is `nhncloud`. For security reasons, it is recommended to change the password. If you are using replication connection, you must change the `requirepass` and `masterauth` values at the same time.

### Automatic HA Configuration Script
A Redis instance of NHN Cloud provides a script that automatically configures an HA environment. You can use the script only for **a new instance immediately after installation**, and cannot use after changing the set values from redis.conf.

To use the script, the following settings are required.

##### Copy key pair
The instance running the installation script must have a key pair (PEM file) required to connect to other instances. The key pair can be copied as follows.

- centos
```
local> scp -i <key pair>.pem <key pair>.pem centos@<floating ip>:/home/centos/
```
- ubuntu
```
local> scp -i <key pair>.pem <key pair>.pem ubuntu@<floating ip>:/home/ubuntu/
```

The key pairs for created instances must be the same.

##### Set security group
You must set a security group (**Network** > **Security Groups**) for communication between Redis instances. Create a security group with the following rules and apply it to a Redis instance.

| Direction | IP protocol | Port range| Ether| Remote|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inbound |TCP | 6379| IPv4| Instance IP(CIDR)|
| Inbound |TCP | 16379| IPv4| Instance IP(CIDR)|
| Inbound |TCP | 26379| IPv4| Instance IP(CIDR)|

#### Sentinel Automatic Configuration
You will need 3 Redis instances to configure Sentinel. After copying the key pair to the instance used as the master, run the script as follows.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_sentinel.sh
```

Enter the private IPs of the master and replica in turn. You can check the private IP of each instance with the `hostname -I` command.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_sentinel.sh
Enter Master's IP: 192.168.0.33
Enter Replica-1's IP: 192.168.0.27
Enter Replica-2's IP: 192.168.0.97
```

Enter the file name of the copied key pair.
```
shell> Enter Pemkey's name: <key pair>.pem
```

#### Cluster Automatic Configuration
6 Redis instances are required for Cluster configuration. After copying the key pair to the instance used as the master, run the script as follows.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_cluster.sh
```

Enter the private IPs of Redis instances used for a cluster in turn. You can check the private IP of each instance with the `hostname -I` command.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_cluster.sh
Enter cluster-1'IP:  192.168.0.79
Enter cluster-2'IP: 192.168.0.10
Enter cluster-3'IP: 192.168.0.33
Enter cluster-4'IP:  192.168.0.116
Enter cluster-5'IP:  192.168.0.91
Enter cluster-6'IP:  192.168.0.32
```

Enter the file name of the copied key pair.

```
shell> Enter Pemkey's name: <key pair>.pem
```

Enter `yes` to complete cluster configuration.
